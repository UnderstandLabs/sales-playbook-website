# Design Brainstorming: GoodData AI Modernization Sales Playbook

**Design Movement**: **Cybernetic Brutalism**
**Core Principles**:
1.  **Raw & Exposed**: Emphasize the "under the hood" nature of the AI Lake. Use monospaced fonts, visible grid lines, and "terminal-like" aesthetics to convey technical depth.
2.  **High Contrast**: Stark contrasts between deep blacks/purples and neon magenta/cyan to represent the "energy" of AI modernization.
3.  **Modular & Blocky**: Layouts that feel like assembled components (APIs, metrics), reflecting the "composable" nature of the solution.
4.  **Data-First**: Visuals should look like data streams, code snippets, or architectural diagrams rather than generic marketing fluff.

**Color Philosophy**:
*   **Background**: Deep Void Black (`#050505`) or Darkest Purple (`#0F0518`) - The "unknown" legacy data.
*   **Primary**: Neon Magenta (`#FF00FF`) - The "AI Lift" energy.
*   **Secondary**: Electric Cyan (`#00FFFF`) - The "clarity" of the semantic layer.
*   **Text**: Off-white/Matrix Green for code elements.
*   *Reasoning*: This palette screams "modern," "technical," and "disruptive," aligning with the "Break the Dashboard Barrier" message.

**Layout Paradigm**:
*   **Asymmetric Grid**: Avoid centered containers. Use a split-screen approach where "Legacy" (left/bottom) contrasts with "Modern" (right/top).
*   **Sticky Sidebars**: Navigation that looks like a code editor file tree.
*   **Overlapping Layers**: Elements that slide over each other to show "transformation."

**Signature Elements**:
1.  **Glitch Effects**: Subtle text glitches on hover to represent the "instability" of legacy dashboards.
2.  **Code Block Containers**: Content wrapped in syntax-highlighted containers.
3.  **Topographic/Wireframe Backgrounds**: Subtle animated lines (like the slide deck) but interactive.

**Interaction Philosophy**:
*   **"Decode" Animations**: Text that reveals itself like a terminal output.
*   **Hover-to-Inspect**: Hovering over a "dashboard" element reveals the underlying "spaghetti logic" vs. "clean YAML."

**Animation**:
*   **Staggered Entry**: Elements load in with a "typing" or "compiling" effect.
*   **Parallax Scroll**: Background wireframes move at different speeds.

**Typography System**:
*   **Headings**: **Space Grotesk** or **JetBrains Mono** (Bold, Uppercase) - Technical authority.
*   **Body**: **Inter** or **DM Sans** (Clean, readable) - For the narrative.
*   **Code**: **Fira Code** - For the "Analytics-as-Code" examples.

**Design Movement**: **Glassmorphism & Ethereal Tech**
**Core Principles**:
1.  **Transparency & Depth**: Use frosted glass effects to represent the "Glass Box" explainability of the AI Hub.
2.  **Fluidity**: Soft, flowing gradients and shapes to represent the "AI Lake" and the seamless flow of data.
3.  **Light & Clarity**: A lighter, cleaner aesthetic that contrasts with the "dark/opaque" legacy world.
4.  **Human-Centric**: Focus on the *people* (Personas) with soft, approachable UI elements, despite the technical subject.

**Color Philosophy**:
*   **Background**: Deep Royal Purple (`#1C0D3F`) to Light Lavender gradients - The GoodData brand base.
*   **Glass**: White with low opacity and blur - The "lens" through which we see data.
*   **Accents**: Soft Pink (`#ED26B7`) and glowing gradients - The "magic" of AI.
*   *Reasoning*: This feels premium, trustworthy, and "enterprise-ready" without being boring. It emphasizes *clarity* and *insight*.

**Layout Paradigm**:
*   **Floating Cards**: Content sits on floating glass cards over a fluid background.
*   **Z-Pattern Flow**: Guide the eye naturally through the "story" of modernization.
*   **Central Axis**: A strong central visual (the "Lake") that connects all sections.

**Signature Elements**:
1.  **Frosted Glass Cards**: With subtle borders and inner shadows.
2.  **Glowing Orbs**: Background elements that pulse gently.
3.  **Clean Line Icons**: Thin, elegant iconography.

**Interaction Philosophy**:
*   **Smooth Drifts**: Elements float gently.
*   **Soft Glows**: Hover states emit a soft light rather than a hard color change.

**Animation**:
*   **Fade & Float**: Content fades in and floats up.
*   **Blur-in**: Background elements blur into focus.

**Typography System**:
*   **Headings**: **Outfit** or **Plus Jakarta Sans** (Geometric, friendly but modern).
*   **Body**: **Nunito Sans** (Brand aligned, approachable).

**Design Movement**: **Swiss International Style (Digital Remaster)**
**Core Principles**:
1.  **Grid Precision**: Absolute adherence to a strict grid, representing "Governance" and "Order."
2.  **Typography as Hero**: Large, bold type that carries the message ("Break the Dashboard Barrier").
3.  **High Contrast & Flat**: No shadows, no blur. Just bold colors and sharp lines. "Spaghetti Logic" vs. "Clean Code."
4.  **Information Density**: Pack data and insights efficiently, respecting the "Playbook" format.

**Color Philosophy**:
*   **Background**: Stark White (`#FFFFFF`) or Very Light Grey (`#F5F5F5`).
*   **Text**: Deepest Navy/Black (`#0A0A23`).
*   **Accents**: The GoodData Purple (`#1C0D3F`) and Magenta (`#ED26B7`) used as *blocks* of color, not gradients.
*   *Reasoning*: This conveys "Authority," "Truth," and "No-Nonsense." It cuts through the noise.

**Layout Paradigm**:
*   **Modular Bento Grids**: Content organized in strict rectangular blocks.
*   **Horizontal Scroll**: For timelines (The 12-Week Plan).
*   **Split Screen**: Left side fixed navigation/context, right side scrolling content.

**Signature Elements**:
1.  **Thick Dividers**: Bold lines separating sections.
2.  **Oversized Numbers**: "01", "02", "03" for the methodology.
3.  **Swiss Grid Icons**: Minimalist, geometric icons.

**Interaction Philosophy**:
*   **Snap Scroll**: Sections snap into place.
*   **Hover Inversion**: Black turns to Magenta, White turns to Black. High impact.

**Animation**:
*   **Slide & Reveal**: Panels slide away to reveal content.
*   **Kinetic Type**: Headlines that move or assemble.

**Typography System**:
*   **Headings**: **Helvetica Now Display** or **Inter** (Tight tracking, heavy weight).
*   **Body**: **Roboto** or **Inter** (Neutral, legible).
